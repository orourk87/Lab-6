# Lab-6
Part 1:

In this section of code a temperature sensor was used from the MSP430 board.  The data was taken and converted using tempRAW and temp to get a better understanding of what the temperature might be in celsius.

Part 2:

In this section of code another sensor was added.  This was a light dependent resistor (LDR) that can be used as a light sensor, to collect data on how light an area might be.  The two sensors were then implemented similar to part 1.  For the schematic of the light sensor a 10k resistor was connected to ground and the LDR was connected to 3.3V and where the LDR and 10K resistor met the output was connected to pin P1.4 on the MSP430.
